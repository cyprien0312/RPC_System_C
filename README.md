# RPC_System_C
The repository you provided is an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) system implemented in C. Here's a brief overview based on the files I've analyzed:

client.c
This file contains the client-side logic for the RPC system. It initializes the RPC client, finds the remote function named "add2", and then makes two calls to this function with different operands. The results of these calls are printed to the console.

rpc.c
This file contains the core implementation of the RPC system. It provides functions for initializing the server and client, registering remote functions, finding remote functions by name, making remote function calls, and handling incoming connections and requests on the server side.

rpc.h
This is the header file for the RPC system. It defines the data structures and function prototypes used in the RPC system.

server.c
This file contains the server-side logic for the RPC system. It initializes the RPC server, registers a remote function named "add2", and then starts serving incoming requests. The "add2" function adds two signed 8-bit numbers.

utils.h
This header file provides utility functions and macros used in the RPC system, such as functions for creating listening and commute sockets, and functions for converting between host and network byte order for 64-bit integers.

The contents of utils.c were not included in the current response due to size limitations. Would you like me to fetch the contents of that file as well?
